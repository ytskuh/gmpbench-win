# gmpbench-win
GMPbench ported to windows.



GMPbench is a single threaded integer performance benchmark for common CPUs.

See https://gmplib.org/gmpbench for more information.

The project is built with msys2 and packed with minimal msys2 binarys to simulate a bash environment in order to run the gmpbench bash script.
